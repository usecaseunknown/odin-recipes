    <h1>How to Make "<i>Irish Potato Farls</i>"?</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The word farl originates from the Gaelic word fardel meaning four parts. These potato griddle breads can be made with leftover mashed potatoes if you have them. Serve hot with a little butter and salt or fry them alongside soda bread as part of an Ulster Fry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>{For 8 servings}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cover potatoes with water in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer on medium-high heat until center of potatoes are tender when pricked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain, return potatoes to the pot, and allow to completely dry out over the remaining residual heat.</li>
        <li>Mash with a potato masher until smooth.</li>
        <li>Place warm mashed potato in a medium bowl. Stir in flour, melted butter, and salt. Mix lightly until dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead dough lightly on a well-floured surface. The dough will be sticky. Use a floured rolling pin to flatten into a 9-inch circle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into quarters using a floured knife.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a little flour into the bottom of a skillet and cook farls until evenly browned, about 3 minutes on each side. Season with a little salt and serve straight away.</li>
